# Safety-and-Monitoring
Monitoring of all safety related norms such as Safety Harness(with/without hook), Helmet, Fall Detection and oil spillage
This file presents a comprehensive approach to workplace safety using state-of-the-art computer vision technology. The project is designed to automate the detection of critical safety measures, ensuring compliance and reducing the likelihood of accidents. Key components of the system include:

    Safety Harness Detection: The system uses computer vision algorithms to identify whether workers are wearing safety harnesses. By analyzing video footage in real-time, it can promptly alert supervisors to any non-compliance, helping to prevent falls from heights.

    Helmet Detection: Ensuring that personnel are wearing helmets is crucial in many industries to protect against head injuries. This system can accurately detect the presence or absence of helmets on workers, thereby enforcing safety protocols and minimizing the risk of injury from falling objects or slips.

    Fall Detection: Utilizing advanced machine learning models, the system is capable of detecting falls as they happen. By continuously monitoring video feeds, the system can recognize sudden and abnormal movements indicative of a fall. Once detected, it can immediately trigger alarms and notify emergency response teams to provide timely assistance.

    Oil Spillage Detection: Oil spills pose significant hazards in industrial environments, increasing the risk of slips, falls, and potential fire hazards. This system includes a module specifically designed to detect oil spillage on surfaces. By identifying changes in surface texture and color through real-time image analysis, it can quickly detect and report oil spills, allowing for immediate clean-up and minimizing the risk of accidents and environmental damage.

The integration of these features into a unified safety and monitoring system offers a proactive solution to managing occupational hazards. This file includes the architecture design, model training procedures, data requirements, implementation strategies, and testing results. The goal is to enhance workplace safety by leveraging computer vision to maintain constant vigilance, thereby ensuring a safer environment for all workers.
